## File Descriptions
1. `report.ipynb`: Summarizes all implementations with function calls to individual algorithms.
2. `RunMe_approach_1.ipynb`: Standalone implementation of [1].
3. `RunMe_approach_2.ipynb`: Standalone implementation of [2].
4. `RunMe_approach_3.ipnb`: Standalone implementation of [3].
5. `presentation.ipynb`: Similar to `report.ipynb` but with lesser details. This was used for class presentation.
